# Digital Content & Compliance Architecture for Aerospace Engineering

## Context
A major aerospace engineering organization required a structured digital content and compliance architecture to support complex engineering documentation, certification processes, and long-term traceability within a strictly regulated environment.

The initiative focused on strengthening governance, improving architectural clarity across legacy and future systems, and enabling scalable digital engineering practices aligned with aviation regulatory expectations.

## Constraints
- Stringent aviation regulatory compliance and auditability requirements  
- High security and controlled access to engineering information  
- Integration with legacy engineering and documentation platforms  
- Long lifecycle retention, certification traceability, and evidence preservation  
- Multi-stakeholder governance across engineering, IT, and compliance domains  

## Approach
- Defined a compliant **target architecture** for digital content and documentation management  
- Established **governance structures and decision frameworks** aligning engineering, IT, and regulatory stakeholders  
- Modeled **architecture viewpoints, information flows, and system responsibilities** to support certification and audit scenarios  
- Produced structured **architecture artifacts and analysis** to guide platform and integration decisions  
- Facilitated **stakeholder alignment and architectural decision-making** in a regulated delivery context  

## Outcomes
- Strengthened **compliance, audit readiness, and certification traceability** for engineering documentation  
- Improved **clarity of system responsibilities and governance ownership** across the landscape  
- Reduced **architectural ambiguity** between legacy environments and future platform direction  
- Enabled a **scalable foundation for digital engineering and long-term information governance**  

## Relevance
This work reflects core themes that continue to shape modern regulated organizations:

- Architecture operating under **strict governance and compliance**
- Managing **complex legacy-to-future platform transitions**
- Designing **information architectures with long lifecycle accountability**
- Aligning **technology decisions with regulatory and organizational reality**

These principles remain central to my current enterprise architecture practice across regulated and asset-intensive sectors.
