I’m Soufiane Bouarfa, a freelance Enterprise/Solution Architect and founder of Novel Insights.

My work focuses on enabling **decision-making and delivery through governance**—helping regulated, asset-heavy organizations modernize platforms, information governance, and operating models under real constraints (security, compliance, procurement, legacy).

## What I bring
- Governance-led architecture that supports accountable transformation
- Strong technical credibility paired with stakeholder alignment
- Structured deliverables: target architectures, roadmaps, decision logs, architecture boards alignment

## Domains
- Government and infrastructure programs
- Aviation and other safety-critical, regulated environments
